## Collaboration Guidelines

- Work on a new branch for each feature or bug fix (do not commit directly to main).
- Push your branch to GitHub and create a pull request for review.
- Assign reviewers and request feedback before merging.
- Ensure your code passes all tests before submitting a pull request.
- Use clear, descriptive commit messages.
- Update the README.md or documentation if your changes affect usage or features.
- Communicate regularly with the team about progress and blockers.

# Web Search App Project

## Project Overview
This project is a web search application designed for both smartphone and browser platforms. It allows users to search a specific website and delivers precise, relevant results. The project is inspired by requirements from a client, Mr. Tony Stark, and is being developed by Binary Bakery.

- BeautifulSoup (HTML parsing)
- Unittest (testing)

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the main program: `python main.py`
4. Run tests: `python main.py` (tests run automatically before main)

## Development Approach
- Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) and Test-Driven Development (TDD)
- Collaborative, review-based workflow (feature branches, pull requests)

## Project Structure
- `main.py` - Main crawler, search logic, and tests
- `README.md` - Project documentation

## Contributing
- Create a new branch for each feature or fix
- Submit pull requests for review
- Do not merge directly to `main` without review
